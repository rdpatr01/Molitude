# Movie Point of Sale System#

**Molitude** is a full-featured Point of Sale System for Movie Theatres. This was created in a class room setting, to show the level of difficulty of not using data structures like arrays. I am proud of this program because it is the most complex program that I have created and also shows a decent summation of my limited skills.
